To ensure this list remains a high-quality, state-of-the-art resource, please adhere to the following strict guidelines before submitting a Pull Request (PR).

## The Golden Rule (核心原则)
We strictly prioritize **Quality over Quantity**. We only accept frameworks, hardware, and algorithms that are industry-recognized, actively maintained, or introduce groundbreaking SOTA capabilities in embodied AI.

## How to Contribute (操作流)
1. **Search First:** Check the existing README and open Pull Requests to ensure your submission is not a duplicate.
2. **Fork and Branch:** Fork this repository and create a new branch for your addition (e.g., `git checkout -b add-new-simulator`).
3. **Format Strictly:** Follow the exact Markdown syntax used in the list:
   `* [Project Name](https://link-to-repo) - A brief, objective description ending with a period.`
4. **Keep it Alphabetical:** Insert your new entry in alphabetical order within the relevant category.
5. **Submit a PR:** Title your PR clearly (e.g., `Add LeRobot to Foundation Models`) and briefly explain *why* this project is awesome in the description box.

## What We Do NOT Accept (拒绝清单)
* Dead projects (no commits in the last 12 months).
* Closed-source commercial products masquerading as open-source ecosystems.
* Low-effort tutorials, generic news articles, or aggregated spam sites.

By submitting a Pull Request, you agree to follow these conventions. The maintainers reserve the right to reject or request modifications for any submission that does not meet our community standards.
